Everything in javascript happens in execution context

Execution context -> Two parts :
Memory(Variable Environment) --> key : value, a : 10, function()
Code(Thread Of Execution) --> Code is executed line by line

javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language

single threaded -> only one command at a time
synchronous single-threaded -> only one command at a time in a specific order i.e., it can only go to next line once the current line is finished executing
